👋 About Me

I am a Data Analyst with hands-on experience in data analytics, business intelligence, and dashboard development. I have professional exposure through a data analytics internship and a strong technical background in Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI.

I have worked on real-world datasets across healthcare, sales, marketing, and operations, building dashboards, predictive models, and structured reports to support data-driven decision-making. With a foundation in software development and enterprise applications, I bring both analytical thinking and technical execution to analytics problems.
